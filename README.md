## Getting Started.

Make sure you have nodejs installed by running the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If the output is not the version of your nodejs installation, install nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

After installing nodejs install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)
if you have it then install the project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you don't have nodemon running globally, install:

```bash
npm i -g nodemon
```

Create a dotenv file and add

```bash
HOST=hostname
PORT=portnumber
```

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
